                <h3>Artista Visual</h3>
                <p>MFA Visual Arts, mention in painting, Pontificia Universidad Católica de Chile (1993).
                    Master in Digital Design and Multimedia, Tracor Chile (2003).
                    Currently works as a professor at the Art School of Universidad Católica,
                    in the areas of digital image and creation workshops.

                <p>During the last decades her artistic production has centered around the displacement of drawing and
                    its relationship with photography. By linking the analog and the digital, she has been building an
                    archive of images that, captured or digitally fabricated, elaborate an unstable border between the
                    public and the private, the visible and the invisible, and the collective and the individual memory.
                    For example, in a residency and exhibition at the Museo del Barro, Paraguay (2006), she visited and
                    recorded some of the files from the Archive of Terror. With the material collected, she produced
                    works, such as "The names/Lost traces" for the curator Cristián Gómez-Moya's project "Human
                    Rights/Copy Rights, Visual archives in the era of declassification", exhibited at the Museo de Arte
                    Contemporáneo of Santiago in 2011. Another important project was "Graphic crossing" (2004), where
                    she used digital photography to record five minimal and ephemeral urban interventions in emblematic
                    places in downtown Santiago, which were later digitally intervened. Both projects were supported by
                    FONDART.
                </p>
                <p>An important part of her career has been involved in collaborative work, and since 1989 she has
                    participated with Ximena Zomosa and Paz Carvajal in group projects. These include "Project of a
                    Boundary", a series of site-specific installations at MAC Valdivia, the Fuller Museum of Art,
                    Brockton, and Latincollector Art Center, NY, in the USA, and ArtSpace, Sydney, Australia
                    (1999-2005); and "Outside the edge", at Museo Regional de Punta Arenas, Chile, Espacio de Arte
                    Contemporáneo de Montevideo, Uruguay, mARTadero, Cochabamba, Bolivia, La Curtiduría, Oaxaca, Mexico,
                    and Casa E, Valparaíso, Chile (2012-13).
                </p>
                <p>Other recent collective projects include: "Magic Block", exhibited at Stiftelsen 3,14, International
                    Foundation for Contemporary Art, in Bergen, Norway, 2013, and at Museo de la Solidaridad Salvador
                    Allende, Santiago, in 2014 (curated by Brandon LaBelle and Soledad García). She is currently
                    participating in the collective project "Écfrasis" of the group MuroSur, under the curatorial
                    direction of Ana María Fernández. This work consisted of sound works, the recording of an audio
                    description of a fictitious or real visual work for an exhibition in Amsterdam, Holland. With this
                    material a double vinyl was recorded and presented in November 2018 at the Printing Plant Art Book
                    Fair in Amsterdam, and presented in Chile at Galería D21 in Santiago, in 2019 (curators: Ana María
                    Fernández, Martín La Roche and Giancarlo Pazzanese).
                </p>
                <p>The aforementioned are examples of an artistic methodology focused on long projects, often
                    collaborative and/or collective, with displacements of traditional art techniques and involving the
                    digital image. In the financing of these works she has received support from FONDART, Consejo
                    Nacional de la Cultura y las Artes (1998, 1999, 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2008) and the DIRAC Grant,
                    Dirección de Asuntos Culturales del Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores de Chile (2002, 2005 and
                    2011).
